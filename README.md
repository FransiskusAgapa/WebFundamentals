MVP
As a diligent student, I want to reward myself if I finish my homework, and based on the time of day:

I want a latte if it's before 10 am
I want a hot chocolate it's between 10 am and 4 pm
I want ice cream between 4 pm - 10 pm.
If it's after 10 pm, I don't want anything other than sleep!
Feature 1
Building off the MVP, if I'm up for ice cream, I want strawberry - but only if it's Wednesday. Otherwise, I want vanilla.

Feature 2 (hard) - Optional
Building off Feature 1, I want to adjust the current conditions and add a new option so that if the time is between 3 pm - 6 pm, I want to have it pick either ice cream or hot chocolate depending on if the time is even or odd.

Feature 3 (super hard) - Optional
Building off Feature 2, I want my options for the 3 pm - 6 pm slot to be a random selection: if the time is even, I want my selections to be ice cream, cookies, or candy. If the time is odd, I want my selections to be hot chocolate, tea, or cake.
